# Mapping of Metrics

## Project Overview

"Mapping of Metrics" is a comprehensive metric management system designed to help businesses track, analyze, and optimize their performance through detailed metrics and their interconnections. The platform leverages historical data, correlation analysis, and visualization to provide deep insights into business operations, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.

## Key Components

### 1. Metric Management
#### Goal: 
To create, update, and manage various business metrics.
#### Features:
- **Metric Creation:** Users can input metrics, such as "Customer Acquisition Cost" and categorize them (e.g., KPI, Input, Output).
- **Detailed Information:** Each metric includes type, category, confidence level, description, hypothesis, value type (e.g., percentage, value), rhythm (frequency of measurement), and technical descriptions.
- **Tagging:** The platform supports tagging metrics for better organization and filtering.

### 2. Connections Between Metrics
#### Goal:
To visualize and define relationships between different metrics to understand cause and effect, facilitating deeper insights into how metrics influence one another.
#### Features:
- **Metric Relationships:** Users can specify connections between metrics, indicating how one metric may impact another.
- **Network Mapping:** This feature maps out a network of metrics, showcasing interdependencies.
- **Notes and Comments:** Functionality to add comments or notes to these connections and manage them effectively.

### 3. Historical Data Management
#### Goal:
To track and analyze historical data for each metric to assess performance over time.
#### Features:
- **Data Input:** The platform allows the input and management of historical data points for each metric, manually or through bulk import.
- **Performance Visualization:** Supports visualization and analysis, such as comparing actual performance against forecasts.

### 4. Correlation Analysis
#### Goal:
To calculate and analyze the correlation coefficients between connected metrics, helping to quantify the strength of their relationships.
#### Features:
- **Correlation Calculations:** Identify the most influential metrics and understand the dynamic between different data points.
- **Accuracy:** Ensures that correlations are calculated using matching date ranges.

### 5. User Interface
#### Goal:
To provide a user-friendly, intuitive interface for interacting with metrics and their relationships.
#### Features:
- **Forms:** Forms for inputting and updating metrics.
- **Visual Representations:** Visual representations of metrics and their connections.
- **Customization:** Customizable tags and categories to enhance user experience.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React with React Router, styled using Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Django REST framework for API endpoints.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

## Usage
1. **Creating Metrics:** Navigate to the "Metrics" section and use the form to create new metrics.
2. **Managing Connections:** Use the "Connections" section to define and visualize relationships between metrics.
3. **Inputting Historical Data:** Add historical data points in the "Historical Data" section for trend analysis.
4. **Analyzing Performance:** Use the visualization tools to assess metric performance and correlation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Reporting:** Implement detailed reporting features for exporting and sharing insights.
- **Automated Data Import:** Integrate with external data sources for automated historical data import.
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Add more sophisticated visualization options for better insights.
