### 9. Forecasting
#### Goal:
To predict future values of metrics based on historical data and trends.
#### Features:
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Implement various forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for different types of metrics.
- **Forecast Visualization:** Display forecasted values alongside historical data for easy comparison.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide confidence intervals for forecasts to indicate prediction uncertainty.

### 10. Anomaly Detection
#### Goal:
To identify unusual patterns or outliers in metric data that deviate from expected behavior.
#### Features:
- **Statistical Anomaly Detection:** Use statistical methods to identify data points that fall outside expected ranges.
- **Machine Learning-based Detection:** Implement more advanced anomaly detection algorithms for complex patterns.
- **Real-time Alerts:** Set up notifications for detected anomalies to enable quick responses.

### 11. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
#### Goal:
To clean, transform, and enhance raw data for improved analysis and model performance.
#### Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Automated processes to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Create new features from existing data to capture more complex relationships.
- **Data Transformation:** Apply scaling, normalization, and other transformations to prepare data for various analyses.
- **Time Series Preprocessing:** Specific techniques for handling time-based data, such as resampling and lag feature creation.
