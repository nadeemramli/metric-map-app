Example:
    >>> historical_data = {
        'date': pd.date_range(start='2022-01-01', periods=120, freq='D'),
        'value': np.random.normal(100, 10, 120)
    }
    >>> suggestions = generate_automated_suggestions(historical_data)
    >>> print(suggestions)

Notes:
    - The function expects a dictionary with 'date' and 'value' keys, converting it into a DataFrame.
    - It generates suggestions based on percentage changes in the most recent period (last 30 days) compared to the overall period.
    - Additional analysis includes volatility assessment over the last 7 days.
    - The function returns a list of strings with suggested actions, which can be empty if no significant trends or issues are detected.
    - This module is helpful for dynamic environments where adjusting strategies in response to recent data is crucial.
