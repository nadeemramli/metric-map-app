Causal Inference
================

This module is dedicated to causal inference analysis, focusing on determining the relationships between variables
using statistical methods such as Granger causality tests and correlation analyses.

    Functions:
    lagged_correlation_test(x, y, max_lag=10): Performs a correlation test between two time series variables 'x' and 'y'
        for different lag values up to 'max_lag'. It helps identify if past values of 'x' are statistically significant
        predictors of 'y'.

def pearsonr(x, y):

    Functions:
    pearsonr(x, y): Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and its p-value for two datasets, indicating the linear
        relationship and its statistical significance.

    # Simple implementation of Pearson correlation and its p-value
    n = len(x)
    r = np.corrcoef(x, y)[0,1]

"""
Example:
    >>> x = np.random.normal(size=100)
    >>> y = np.roll(x, shift=1)  # y is x shifted by one step
    >>> results = lagged_correlation_test(x, y, max_lag=5)
    >>> print(results)
    >>> correlation, p_value = pearsonr(x, y)
    >>> print(f"Pearson Correlation: {correlation}, P-Value: {p_value}")

Notes:
    - The 'lagged_correlation_test' returns a dictionary with lag values as keys and their corresponding p-values as values,
      assessing the potential causal impact of 'x' on 'y' at each lag.
    - The 'pearsonr' function provides a straightforward way to assess the linear relationship between two datasets.
    - These tools are essential for studies where the temporal sequence of data points is crucial, such as in economics,
      psychology, or meteorology.
